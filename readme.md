# BlueInk Test
Things you will need for this to work
   - A Google Maps API key
   - A database with the insert file I was given.

You will need to enter database credentials (I've only tested with MySQL) into classes/connect.php and replace GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY key with your API key in test.php After those things are done, you should be able to run it by executing test.php. It should return a table containing the total miles traveled in each state.
